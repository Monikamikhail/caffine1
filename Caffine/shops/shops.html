         <p> B8TA.This high-tech, high-touch showroom, which just announced a partnership with Macy's, is located inside Macy's Herald Square and is focused on emphasizing the brands it curates. The shop-in-shop concept is designed to fit in nearly any retail store and it employs highly trained store associates that know brands as well as the manufacturers, allowing them to engage with customers at a higher level.

         <p> EVERLANE.This is the first of two physical locations for the e-commerce darling, which once promised it would sooner fold operations before going brick and mortar. The new store, opened in December 2017, features T-shirts, cashmere, denim and shoes from a brand focused on transparency in its supply chain.</p>

         <p> KITH.This concept has a cool kid, sneakerhead vibe, completed by the rows upon rows of street shoes lining the windows and circular in-store sneaker displays. Store associates help customers locate a particular shoe and are also well-informed on the history of each line. One of the floors even features a "treat bar" with ice cream and shakes for customers to enjoy.
