    <h4 class="cap3"> Known for his meticulous attention to detail and for his garments’ impeccable construction, bespoke tailor T-Michael derives as much satisfaction from the design process as he does from the end result.</h4>

<h4>From the crowded cobblestone streets of London to the quiet alleyways of Bergen, Norway, T-Michael creates hand-sewn menswear that may as well come with its own lovingly worn-in passport. Born and raised as the youngest of five children in Accra, Ghana, Michael Tetteh Nartey moved to London as a teenager before traversing the North Sea to Norway at the age of 23. After earning a degree in men’s tailoring, he launched his eponymous line in 1996 and now also collaborates with Alexander Helle on Norwegian Rain, a collection of hardy and sartorial rainwear with a Japanese approach. Though his work often keeps him busy, he makes time for a quiet breather on his couch or a spot of whiskey at one of his favorite neighborhood bars.

    <h4 class="cap3"> What advice do you have for someone undergoing a career change?</h4>

<h4> It’s a cliché to say, “Follow your heart,” because your heart doesn’t pay the bills, but things are going to get tough either way. And it’s much easier to keep going if you’re actually doing something you really have a passion for. It means you can stay up all night and work 24 hours a day, because it feels right. Of course you need to get your skills in order, but choose what you truly want to be working with.
